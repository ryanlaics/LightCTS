# LightCTS: A Lightweight Model for Correlated Time Series Forecasting
This is the original pytorch implementation of LightCTS in the following paper: LightCTS: A Lightweight Model for Correlated Time Series Forecasting.
This code is based on the implementation of [Graph WaveNet](https://github.com/nnzhan/Graph-WaveNet).

## Requirements
- python 3
- see `requirements.txt`

## Data Preparation
LightCTS is implemented on several public correlated time series forecasting datasets.

- **METR-LA** and **PEMS-BAY** from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10FOTa6HXPqX8Pf5WRoRwcFnW9BrNZEIX) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14Yy9isAIZYdU__OYEQGa_g) links provided by [DCRNN](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN)

- **Solar-Energy** and **Electricity** datasets from [https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data](https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data). Uncompress them and move them to the data folder.
